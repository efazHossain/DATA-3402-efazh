    "You are tasked with evaluating card counting strategies for black jack. In order to do so, you will use object oriented programming to create a playable casino style black jack game where a computer dealer plays against $n$ computer players and possibily one human player. If you don't know the rules of blackjack or card counting, please google it. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few requirements:\n",
    "* The game should utilize multiple 52-card decks. Typically the game is played with 6 decks.\n",
    "* Players should have chips.\n",
    "* Dealer's actions are predefined by rules of the game (typically hit on 16). \n",
    "* The players should be aware of all shown cards so that they can count cards.\n",
    "* Each player could have a different strategy.\n",
    "* The system should allow you to play large numbers of games, study the outcomes, and compare average winnings per hand rate for different strategies."
